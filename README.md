### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MartÃ­n, I'm a computer science engineering student at the National University of Distance Education (UNED) in Spain.

### What do I do?

I'm getting specialized in cybersecurity, but I'm also interested in many other fields of Computer Science, like quantum computing, algorithms, compilers... I consider myself a hacker, not one of those hoddie wearing criminals, but a person who likes to learn how things are made and how do they work.

### What am I working on right now?

I may not be the most active user of GitHub, because I usually have not very much time. But when I have time I like to work in the following projects:

- I have an idea for a game, and I decided to develop it from scratch, and making it "more mine". Now I'm making the game engine, you can browse the code in the n3m1-sys/AdaEngine repository.

### My college projects

At this moment I have no college projects visible. But I will publish all the projects I make for college here, so other students may use them as a reference.
(Many of these projects are and will be in spanish).
