### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MartÃ­n, I'm a computer science engineering student at the National University of Distance Education (UNED) in Spain.

### What do I do?

I'm getting specialized in cybersecurity, but I'm also interested in many other fields of Computer Science, like quantum computing, algorithms, compilers... I consider myself a hacker, not one of those hoddie wearing criminals, but a person who likes to learn how things are made and how do they work.

### My college projects

Note: All of these projects are documented in spanish

- https://github.com/n3m1-sys/Estad-PEC-Jun20-UNEDII-public : Some statistics exercises solved with an R Markdown notebook
- https://github.com/n3m1-sys/IC3-PEC-Sep20-UNEDII-Public : 2 VHDL exercises
